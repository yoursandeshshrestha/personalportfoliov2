# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and achievements in web development and web design.

## About Me

I'm a 18-year-old developer and student at Inspiria, passionate about coding and fascinated by computers since childhood. I love using my creativity to build web application, currently I'm mainly focused on learning (Mongodb, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).

Beyond studying and development, I'm fascinated by science, space, technology, and ancient history. I also enjoy playing video games occasionally ðŸŽ®.
